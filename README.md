### Learning Path Dashboard
A web application that allows instructors to create mini-courses with various content types (PDF, text, images, links, videos), track student progress, and facilitate community engagement. Built with Django, MySQL, and Vue.js.

Goal of the project is to make a learning path dashboard web app

### ðŸ“‘Features

## Features

- **Two primary users**: Instructor and Student

### Instructor Features
- Instructors can design micro-courses by uploading content in the form of:
  - Text
  - PDFs
  - Links to external videos, etc.
- Instructors must get their profile verified by the organization they work for before publishing a course. This helps maintain the integrity of the platform.
  
### Student Features
- Students can enroll in courses.
- Students can view live progress for a course, allowing both students and instructors to track progress in real-time.
  - This helps provide timely feedback and correction from the instructor if needed.

### Community Features
- A **Community page** is available to facilitate peer engagement and support.
  
### Marketplace Features
- A **Marketplace** recommends similar courses to students, helping them explore more relevant content.

## Use Cases

- **Educational Institutions**: This platform can be used as part of the evaluation criteria within educational institutions, enabling instructors to design and manage micro-courses, and allowing students to enroll and track their progress.
  
- **Non-Profit Organizations**: The platform can also be used by volunteers and non-profit organizations to provide e-education to underprivileged children at a low cost, especially since many platforms like Coursera, Udemy, etc., are paid and expensive.
